                    <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve told a few people this story, but in the 2000s I started a new job for a
company that had reworked a lot of their software development process a couple
years earlier, after a disastrous software release.  A lot of that process
ended up being much heavier and inflexible than necessary — another story for
another day — but one thing in particular stands out to me: the code review
process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specifically, one quirk of the code review process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the developers were faced with the need for process, they
did what most people might… they looked around and adopted from
well-regarded companies&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cjhuitt.com/posts/changing_circumstances_code_reviews_and_energy_abundance/#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. That company was IBM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many things you might expect from IBM, the process was formal and
detailed. The code reviews involved 4 or more people, all with their own roles
— author, moderator, reader, and reviewer&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cjhuitt.com/posts/changing_circumstances_code_reviews_and_energy_abundance/#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. These people were supposed to gather
in a meeting room with a printed copy of the code diffs and proceed through the
rest of the formal review process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m already imaging readers wincing, but there&amp;rsquo;s one detail forever ingrained
in my memory: the process specified the code review was to happen &lt;em&gt;before the
developer compiled their code&lt;/em&gt;, or ran it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let that sink in a bit: rather than have one developer run an (at the time)
2-15 minute compile, the process said 4 software developers should sit in a
room for a minimum of 30 minutes (and usually an hour or more&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cjhuitt.com/posts/changing_circumstances_code_reviews_and_energy_abundance/#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). In what
world does that even make sense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear in mind this process came from IBM (though I&amp;rsquo;m not convinced they still
used it at the time). It was published by s senior developer (or researcher) at
the company… and had been in use for decades by then. And there is one of the
keys — the process came from experience decades old. From a company known for
their mainframe computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one time, computing resources were scarce. People had to schedule time to
have their program run (perhaps even loading it via punch cards), and if
something went wrong during that time, they either fixed it during their time
slot or waited for another time slot (days or weeks later) to try again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that sort of environment, the costs of a bug could mean the loss of a week
or more, and the cycle time to test and adapt the code equally long. Those
costs meant that spending 10 or even 20 collective developer-hours reviewing
the code might still cost less than one mistake. In that environment, doing a
code review prior to compile or run absolutely made sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then circumstances changed. PCs proliferated. Soon enough you had a
computer on most developer&amp;rsquo;s desks that was waiting around twiddling its
virtual thumbs looking for something to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, what once made complete sense now seems nonsensical. But processes and
habits took longer to catch up&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cjhuitt.com/posts/changing_circumstances_code_reviews_and_energy_abundance/#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; — even for a group of people who generally
all disliked the heavyweight code review process as it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reminded of this when reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/17/care-work/#charismatic-megaprojects&#34;&gt;Cory Doctorow&amp;rsquo;s book
review&lt;/a&gt;
of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/612711/how-infrastructure-works-by-deb-chachra/&#34;&gt;How Infrastructure Works by Deb
Chachra&lt;/a&gt;,
which turned my perception of the constraints between manufacturing and energy
usage on its head:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; We&amp;rsquo;ve spent millennia treating &lt;em&gt;energy as scarce&lt;/em&gt;, despite the fact that
fresh supplies of it arrive on Earth with every sunrise and every moonrise.
Moreover, we&amp;rsquo;ve spent that same period treating &lt;em&gt;materials as infinite&lt;/em&gt; despite
the fact that we&amp;rsquo;ve got precisely one Earth&amp;rsquo;s worth of stuff [&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Chachra proposes that we could – we must – treat material as scarce, and that
one way to do this is to recognize that energy is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;. We can trade energy
for material, opting for more energy intensive manufacturing processes that
make materials easier to recover when the good reaches its end of life. We can
also opt for energy intensive material recovery processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aren&amp;rsquo;t there yet — right now the majority of our energy still derives from
materials pulled out of the ground — but we could be there soon. From the same
article, our current total energy needs use &lt;em&gt;less than 1%&lt;/em&gt; of the solar energy
that reaches the earth. Once we have enough renewable energy to cover our
existing needs, things that once looked nonsensical may suddenly make a lot of
sense.  Like spending a lot more energy recycling material back into usable
forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea genuinely delights me, and I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see how things might adapt
when we get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A method full of pitfalls — also a topic for another day&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cjhuitt.com/posts/changing_circumstances_code_reviews_and_energy_abundance/#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mfagan.com/pdfs/ibmfagan.pdf&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;
from &lt;em&gt;1976&lt;/em&gt; was the source of the process, somewhat modified before I was
subject to it.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cjhuitt.com/posts/changing_circumstances_code_reviews_and_energy_abundance/#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the process was so heavyweight, reviews grew large so developers
could (supposedly) minimize their time involved with it.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cjhuitt.com/posts/changing_circumstances_code_reviews_and_energy_abundance/#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:4&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was an exception for a &amp;ldquo;desktop review&amp;rdquo; with only one other person,
for minor changes. I (and a couple others) latched onto that and made most
of our changes minor (a good habit anyway), and the practice spread, and
eventually nobody was doing the full review part of the process. Then I was
able to get that part of the process removed, since we weren&amp;rsquo;t even doing
it.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cjhuitt.com/posts/changing_circumstances_code_reviews_and_energy_abundance/#fnref:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

                <copyright>©️ Caleb Huitt</copyright>
                
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t remember when I started reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.schlockmercenary.com&#34;&gt;Schlock
Mercenary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cjhuitt.com/posts/mandatory_failure/#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but it was at least ten years
ago. That&amp;rsquo;s a pretty solid quarter of the part of my life I can remember (which
is an odd idea in itself, that a decade could only cover that much time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For well before I started reading and most of the past decade, Howard Tayler
ensured a daily dose of Schlock Mercenary, for free, on the website. Every day.
Weekends included. The entire run of Schlock Mercenary ran for over 20
years&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cjhuitt.com/posts/mandatory_failure/#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and I don&amp;rsquo;t know if there was ever a missed day. Every day, at least
one strip, at least one punchline, and advancing the overall story&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cjhuitt.com/posts/mandatory_failure/#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Besides
the joy, that consistent hit of a small bit of dopamine was its own reassurance
that some things were and are still right in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tayler and his team are now &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/howardtayler/mandatory-failure-schlock-mercenary-book-18&#34;&gt;running a
kickstarter&lt;/a&gt;
for a print run of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.schlockmercenary.com/2017-09-18&#34;&gt;Mandatory
Failure&lt;/a&gt;, the 18th of 20 books in
the strip. It&amp;rsquo;s standalone in that you can read it and understand what&amp;rsquo;s going
on… or, you could &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.schlockmercenary.com/archives/&#34;&gt;read the
archives&lt;/a&gt; or pick up some of the
previous books &lt;a href=&#34;https://shop.schlockmercenary.com/collections/schlock-mercenary-books&#34;&gt;in their
store&lt;/a&gt;
or as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/howardtayler/mandatory-failure-schlock-mercenary-book-18/description&#34;&gt;add-ons once the campaign
ends&lt;/a&gt;.
They&amp;rsquo;ve run multiple campaigns before (which I&amp;rsquo;ve backed) and successfully
delivered results, over and over. It&amp;rsquo;s not something every Kickstarter campaign
can claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend you become a backer — and not just because more backers may
eventually mean more goodies I can purchase, but because it&amp;rsquo;s a good story and
will probably provide you with some hours of amusement and entertainment, like
it did for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author-recommended starting point is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.schlockmercenary.com/2008-02-29&#34;&gt;Book 10: The Longshoreman of
the Apocalypse&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cjhuitt.com/posts/mandatory_failure/#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I think my following the strip for 10 years is an endeavor, what must
20 years of producing it have been like? The mind boggles.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cjhuitt.com/posts/mandatory_failure/#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I recall, there were a couple small diversions in Octobers, but those
were still story, and still with the characters I showed up to read about.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cjhuitt.com/posts/mandatory_failure/#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
