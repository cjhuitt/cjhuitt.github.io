[{"categories":["Recommendations"],"content":"I don’t remember when I started reading Schlock Mercenary1, but it was at least ten years ago. That’s a pretty solid quarter of the part of my life I can remember (which is an odd idea in itself, that a decade could only cover that much time).\nFor well before I started reading and most of the past decade, Howard Tayler ensured a daily dose of Schlock Mercenary, for free, on the website. Every day. Weekends included. The entire run of Schlock Mercenary ran for over 20 years2, and I don’t know if there was ever a missed day. Every day, at least one strip, at least one punchline, and advancing the overall story3. Besides the joy, that consistent hit of a small bit of dopamine was its own reassurance that some things were and are still right in the world.\nTayler and his team are now running a kickstarter for a print run of Mandatory Failure, the 18th of 20 books in the strip. It’s standalone in that you can read it and understand what’s going on… or, you could read the archives or pick up some of the previous books in their store or as add-ons once the campaign ends. They’ve run multiple campaigns before (which I’ve backed) and successfully delivered results, over and over. It’s not something every Kickstarter campaign can claim.\nI recommend you become a backer — and not just because more backers may eventually mean more goodies I can purchase, but because it’s a good story and will probably provide you with some hours of amusement and entertainment, like it did for me.\nThe author-recommended starting point is Book 10: The Longshoreman of the Apocalypse ↩︎\nIf I think my following the strip for 10 years is an endeavor, what must 20 years of producing it have been like? The mind boggles. ↩︎\nAs I recall, there were a couple small diversions in Octobers, but those were still story, and still with the characters I showed up to read about. ↩︎\n","description":"","tags":["schlock","kickstarter"],"title":"Kickstarter for Schlock Mercenary: Mandatory Failure","uri":"/posts/mandatory_failure/"}]
